# SkyLore: Exploring the Night Sky Across Cultures

### What is SkyLore?

The HackTX 2025 theme, **"Celestial,"** immediately intrigued us. During the opening ceremony’s tribute to Indigenous peoples, a question sparked our imagination:  
*Did every ancient culture see the sky differently? Why do we only use the Roman constellations today?*

As we brainstormed, we discovered that one of our teammates had Indigenous roots — and from that connection, **SkyLore** was born. We wanted to go beyond building just an educational app. Our goal became to **combine cultural learning with citizen science** — allowing people to explore how different civilizations viewed the stars while contributing real data to modern research.

By inviting users to photograph the night sky and share their observations, SkyLore transforms cultural curiosity into meaningful impact. Each submission adds to a growing, public dataset that visualizes global **light pollution trends**, helping scientists, educators, and communities understand how our skies are changing.

As users learn about lost constellations and the stories behind them, they also become **citizen scientists**, helping preserve the beauty and knowledge of the night sky for generations to come.
